# About Spencer Pollock
[A link to my website](https://spollock.ca)

My name is Spencer Pollock. I am an outgoing, energetic software developer that is looking to help bring a fresh take on projects. I work towards helping the development community remain inclusive and full of pride in all projects and teams. I specialize in low-level development and tooling. I have also started taking on a DevOps lifestyle as well. I enjoy hiking, reading/writing, playing video games and hanging out with good company. I always look forward to a new adventure or challenge.
